## Backtracking questions

1. N queens 

2. Word Search 
     O(m x n 4 ^ L)

3. House Robber III 
     time complexity On, where n is the no of nodes in the tree , since we visit all nodes once
     Space O(n), max depth of recursive call is height of the tree which is n in worst case

4. Route IP addresses 

5. Flood Fill 
     Time complexity O mxn , m is the row, n is column in grid
     Space complexity o mxn, recursion stack grows to total cell count

6. Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid 
     m empty cell, n extra stones, O n^m
     space , recursion stack = 9
7. Binary Tree Paths 

8. Binary Watch 

9. Optimal Account Balancing 

10. Sudoku Solver 
     O(9(n*m)) time and takes O(n*m) space.
     worst case O(9^81)
     average case O(9^k), k being no of empty cells

     take u forward solution
